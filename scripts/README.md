## Scripts

Use this folder for small, reusable scripts such as:

- Data downloaders (e.g. fetching price data via `yfinance`).
- Batch sentiment scoring or technical indicator computation to produce CSV outputs.
- Report generators that run notebooks programmatically (e.g. with `papermill`).

These are optional but can help showcase automation skills beyond the notebooks.
